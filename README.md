# Solutions to Reinforcement Learning An Introduction Sutton 2nd

Welcome to this project. It is a tiny project where we don't do too much coding (yet) but we cooperate together to finish some tricky exercises from famous RL book Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction by Sutton. You may know that this book, especially the second version which was published last year, has no official solution manual. If you send your answer to the email address that the author leaved, you will be returned a fake answer sheet that is incomplete and old. So, why don't we write our own? Most of problems are mathematical proof in which one can learn the therotical backbone nicely but some of them are quite challenging coding problems. Both of them will be updated gradually but math will go first.

Main author would be me and current main cooperater is Zhiqi Pan. 

ABOUT MISTAKES: Don't even expect the solutions be perfect, there are always mistakes. And, sometimes the problems are just open. Show your ideas and question them in 'issues' at any time!


Let's roll'n out!

[UPDATE JAN 2020] Chapter 11 updated. One might have to read the referenced link to Sutton's paper in order to understand some part. Espeically how and why Emphatic-TD works.

[UPDATE JAN 2020] Chapter 10 is long but interesting! Move on!

[UPDATE DEC 2019] Chapter 9 takes long time to read thoroughly but practices are surprisingly just a few. So after uploading the Chapter 9 pdf and I really do think I should go back to previous chapters to complete those programming practices.

# Chapter 11
Major challenges about off-policy learning. Like Chapter 9, practices are short.

# Chapter 10
It is a substantial complement to Chapter 9. Still many open problems which are very interesting.

# Chapter 9
Long chapter, short practices.

# Chapter 8
Finished without programming. Plan on creating additional exercises to this Chapter because many materials are lack of practice.

# Chapter 7
Finished without programming. Thanks for help from Zhiqi Pan.

# Chapter 6
Finished without programming

# Chapter 5
Partially finished.

# Chapter 4
Finished. 
Ex4.7 Partially finished. 
Dat DP question will burn my mind and macbook but I encourage any one who cares nothing about that trying to do yourself. Running through it forces you remember everything behind ordinary DP.:)
