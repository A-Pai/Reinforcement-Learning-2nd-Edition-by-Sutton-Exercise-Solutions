# Solutions-of-Reinforcement-Learning-An-Introduction-Sutton-2nd

Welcome to cooperate together to finish the best answer book for the Reinforcement Learning, an Introduction by Sutton.
It is the project trying to give an accurate answer to the 2nd edition of this legendary book which is currently lacking an officil one. Also, it is a chance for anyone to communicate questions and ideas in the RL field.

Let's roll'n out!
